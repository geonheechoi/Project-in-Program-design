Problem 1 (50 points) - A furniture renting store has asked you to create a program that calculates the rental costs. The store rents several types of furniture. Furniture is rented monthly. 1. A minimum fee (usually higher than monthly cost) is charged for the first month. 2. After the first month, the store charges a monthly rental fee. 3. There is a maximum charge for any given year. 4. The program takes furniture selection and number of months as input. It calculates and prints the charge. 5. Input validation: the program validates the input for furniture selection (1-5) and numbers of months (greater than 0). If any of the two inputs is invalid, the program print a message and exit.

Problem 1 (50 points) - A furniture renting store has asked you to create a program that calculates the rental costs. The store rents several types of furniture. Furniture is rented monthly. 1. A minimum fee (usually higher than monthly cost) is charged for the first month. 2. After the first month, the store charges a monthly rental fee. 3. There is a maximum charge for any given year. 4. The program takes furniture selection and number of months as input. It calculates and prints the charge. 5. Input validation: the program validates the input for furniture selection (1-5) and numbers of months (greater than 0). If any of the two inputs is invalid, the program print a message and exit. Furniture First Month (minimum) Monthly Cost after the First Month Maximum per Year Sofa $60 $45 $450 Loveseat $45 $30 $280 4 Post Bed $55 $38 $350 Dresser $28 $25 $200 Kitchen Table $35 $20 $220 An example input/output: Please select from the following menu: 1. Sofa, 2. Loveseat, 3. 4 Post Bed, 4. Dresser 5. Kitchen Table Enter furniture selection: 1 Enter months rented: 3 Amount due ($): 150
Problem 2 â€“ Tracking Comet Halley (50 points)
Comet Halley is visible to the naked eye from Earth every 76 years. Its last appearance was
in 1986. Given any year after 1986 as input, can you compute the next time Halley will be
seen again? If Halley is visible in the given year, please provide the next one.
1. The program takes a given year as input. It computes the next appearance year
and prints the obtained value.
2. The program cannot use loops (for, while, do/while) to accomplish the described
task.
3. Input validation: the program validates the input year. If the value is smaller than
or equal to 1986, the program prints a message and exits.
